        <h1>Outside of college and programming as a whole, I love playing video games whenever I can as I find them the best source of entertainment. I mainly play games on the Nintendo Switch along with my custom built PC. For my switch, I play games like Super Smash Brothers, the main line Zelda Games, and all the main series Pokemon Games that have been released. For my PC, I play games like Minecraft, Fortnite, a little bit of Overwatch, and Elden Ring</h1>
