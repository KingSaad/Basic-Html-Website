            Hello and welcome to my personal website! This is my first major project that I am working on while trying to learn HTML, CSS, and Javascript in order to get a better grasp of these languages and how they work. As time goes on and the more experience I end up gaining on these languages, I will keep coming back to this website to make improvements and to try and make it look as good as possible.
