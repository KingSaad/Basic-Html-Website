            Hello! This is my personal website where I get to share information about my life. This is also my first major project that I am working on while trying to learn HTML, CSS, and Javascript in order to get a better grasp of these languages and how they work. As time goes on and the more experience I end up gaining on these languages, I will keep coming back to this website in order to make some changes.
