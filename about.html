            Hello! My name is Saad Farooq and this is my first ever website. Currently, I am attending the University of Connecticut as a Freshman, majoring in Computer Science and Engineering. While attending University, my goal is to land as many Software Engineering internships as possible in order to get as much hands on experience as I can. My goal is to become a Software Engineer at a big tech company while being able to work on incredible projects with many different people.
